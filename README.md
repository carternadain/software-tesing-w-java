# Project Reflection  

## Ensuring Functionality and Security  
Making sure my code works and is secure comes down to **testing, validation, and best practices**. I use unit testing and manual testing to catch issues early. Security-wise, I follow **input validation, authentication, and secure coding** practices to prevent vulnerabilities. Regular code reviews and keeping dependencies updated also help.  

## Understanding and Implementing User Needs  
User needs drive development. I gather requirements, break them down into features, and design around usability. The goal is to **build something that actually solves a problem**. If the user experience is bad, the software fails, no matter how well it’s coded.  

## Software Design Approach  
I focus on **modularity, scalability, and maintainability**. I start with planning—**UML diagrams, wireframes, and breaking down features**—before writing code. Agile development keeps things flexible, and I iterate based on feedback. Moving forward, I’ll continue refining my design process with **better documentation and testing strategies**.
